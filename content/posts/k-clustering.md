## Problem
We have set of objects $U = \\{o_1, o_2, ...\\}$, and we want to split them into k clusters.

We also have following definition for distance function.

- $\forall_{i,j} dist(p_i, p_j) = dist(p_j, p_j)$
- $\forall_{i,j} dist(p_i, p_i) = 0$
- $\forall_{i,j} dist(p_i, p_j) > 0$.

At the end, we should have $C = \\{C_1, C_2, ... C_K\\}$.

Let's define *spacing* to be the minimum dist between clusters.
Our goal is to find the k-clustering with maximum spacing.

## Algorithm
Kruskal's Algorithm

- Sort the edges using dist as edge weight
- In each iteration, pick the min edge that doesn't form cycle
  - The connected component = cluster
  - Connecting (merge) two clusters with new edge = *single-link clustering*
- Stops when we have k components
  - equivalent of stop before adding last k - 1 edges for Kruskal's Algorithm

Below is picture of single-linked clusters with k = 3.

## Analyzing Algorithm
Claim:
The components $C_1, C_2, ..., C_k$ formed by deleting the k âˆ’ 1 most expensive edges of the minimum spanning tree T constitute a k-clustering of maximum spacing.

Proof:

- $\mathbb{C} = \\{C_1, C_2, ..., C_k\\}$
- $d^{\*} = (k - 1)$ most expensive edge (since algorithm stops here)
- Assume there is $\mathbb{C'} = \\{C'_1, C'_2, ..., C'_k\\}$
- $\exists C_r$ that contains $p_i$ and $p_j$
  - S.T. $C_r \subsetneq C'_s$ and $C_r\subsetneq C'_t$
  - $p_i \in C'_s$, $p_j \in C'_t$ and $s \neq t$
- Since $p_i$ and $p_j \in C_r$, there is path between them
  - On Kruskal's algorithm, all these edges in the path are at most d*
- Assume $p \in C's$ and $p' \in C't$ that were connected before
  - p - p' was one of the edges, $d(p, p') \leq d*$
- Spacing $\mathbb{C'} \leq d*$
